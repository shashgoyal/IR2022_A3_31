#### About the dataset:
The e-print arXiv GR-QC (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology) collaboration network covers scientific partnerships between authors of works submitted to the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology category. The graph has an ***undirected edge*** from I to j if author I co-authored a paper with author j. If there are k authors on the article, this results in a totally linked (sub)graph with k nodes.

The information pertains to publications published between January 1993 and April 2003. (124 months). It starts only a few months after the arXiv was founded, and so covers the entirety of the GR-QC section's history.
